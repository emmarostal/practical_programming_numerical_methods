Implicit Heun's stepper for Ordinary Differential Equations

The step is given by the formula,

y_{x+h} = y_x + h/2(f(x,y_x)+f(x+h,y_{x+h}))

where the vector y_{x+h} has to be found by solving numerically the above equation using my own root-finder.
The root finder is modified so that it includes dictionaries, holding relevant information, in order to find
the vector y_{x+h} by minimizing the above function for different choices of f(x,y).

The start point for the rootfinding is chosen to be the Euler's step,

y_{x+h} â‰ˆ y_x + h f(x,y_x)

and the error estimate is selected ad the difference between the Euler's step and the implicit Heun's step.

The exercises from Homework #5 ode are recreated using this new stepper.
