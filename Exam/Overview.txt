Implicit Heun's stepper for Ordinary Differential Equations

The step is given by the formula,

y_{x+h} = y_x + h/2(f(x,y_x)+f(x+h,y_{x+h}))
where the vector y_{x+h} has to be found by solving numerically the above equation using your own root-finder.
The start point for your rootfinding can be the Euler's step,

y_{x+h} â‰ˆ y_x + h f(x,y_x)
and the error estimate could be the difference between the Euler's step and the implicit Heun's step.
